# NetMax - Influence Maximization in Social Networks

NetMax is a python library that provides the implementation of several algorithms for the problem of **Influence Maximization in Social Networks**, originally formulated in "Maximizing the Spread of Influence through a Social Network" (Kempe, Kleinberg and Tardos, 2003). NetMax is built upon NetworkX, a popular python library for working with graphs.

## Overview

## TODO
    [X] Implement a configuration object to store the parameters
    [X] Update CELF++ algorithm by computing mg2 from the second iteration instead of the first
    [X] Create "algorithms" directory and:
        [X] Create "simulation_based.py" with the code inside "algorithms.py"
        [X] Create "proxy_based.py" with the code inside "heuristics.py"
    [ ] Complete the multi-agent algorithm pseudocode
    [X] Implement Decreasing Cascade Diffusion Model
